The national festivals of Nepal are Dashin and Tihar and the national animal is cow, national flower is rhododendron & national bird lophophorus. There is lots of opportunity in Nepal. I wish Nepal has job for everyone and may Nepal be clean for tourist and peaceful to live with no fight.

Nepal is a beautiful landlocked country in South Asia Its capital city is Kathmandu. Nepalâ€™s neighboring countries are India and China.  In Nepal there used to be a king but now there is president.  Nepal is divided into three parts: Terai, Pahad & Himilaya.

Nepal is famous for the icy and cold Mt Everest & beautifulreligious Pashupatinath temple which is for Hindus. Mount Everest is the tallest mountain of the world where lots of tourist visits.  Besides these, three places in Nepal that we should visit are:  Lumbani , Chitwan & Pokhara. Lumbani is the place where Lord Buddha was born. And Chitwan is famous for Jungle safari. Pokhara is very beautiful to look at too for the tourist. Ivisited Nepal last year and I really liked the Pani Puri ( water ball) and Momo ( dumplings) of Nepal.

At last, I am proud of being Nepali and love the culture of Nepal.  When I grow up I want to help poor and needy people in Nepal.
